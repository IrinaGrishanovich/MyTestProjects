Take Home Coding Assignment:

Background information:

* The long term project is to create an automation framework for testing UI functionality.

* You are required to do it using Python or Java and Selenium. Feel free to use any additional libraries (such as Maven,
TestNg, PyTest, etc) to build your framework, but the base must be Selenium in Python or Java language.

Your tasks:

1. Keeping in mind the long term goal, create an automation test framework prototype and use the framework to test
a login and registration page. (For this purpose, just select gmail, Hotmail, yahoo, or any public page that requires
a log in. Select one and assume thatâ€™s the company creating the automation. No need to make it generic)

   - No need to build the entire framework and write tons and tons of code, a simple prototype that can explain the
   core structure of your framework would be sufficient.

   - We are mainly looking for the structure of your framework, what model you are using, how your framework will read
   input and generate output, etc.

2. Here are a couple of Test Scenarios for the objective:

   - Use an existing login credentials to login to the application

   - Create a new account and use the new credentials to login to the application

Follow Up: What if 5 credentials are given? And What if 5 new accounts need to be created? How do you scale it?

Feel free to use your own scenarios if you want, these are just examples.

3. Define the test cases for the above scenarios (input, expected results, error cases, etc)

4. Run those cases and provide the final output.

5. When you are done, send us all the files involved, as well as the output file/s.

6. MOST IMPORTANT: Document (in a PDF) your automation framework design, thought process in choosing your approach,
if possible a couple of diagrams to explain your framework structure, test cases, how to install and run them,
how we can scale your framework for the future, etc.
